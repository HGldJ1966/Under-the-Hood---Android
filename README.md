Under the Hood
========================
Description
-----------
The application will run a number of shell commands to get info from the device.

Even though root not needed, rooted devices will give more info.

As the available commands change depending on the ROM used, some commands will fail to work.

Results can be exported to the SD card or shared using the standard android share dialogue (so that they can be e-mailed, for example).

Notes
----------
* This is a personal debug tool, but it might be of use to someone else.
* If the device is rooted, then all commands will be executed as root. If not, then some commands will not return any data.
* I am certain that not all ROMs (factory, or custom) support all commands, but any errors should handled gracefully.
